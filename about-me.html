        <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Jordan and I am originally from New York, but I've lived in Seattle for almost 15 years. I went to school for graphic design and did that professionally in NYC for a couple years and then moved to Seattle to pursue a career in health care. For the last 15 years I've worked at the University of Washington Medical Center Montlake. 
        
            <p>For the first 12 years I worked in the patient care side of the medical center. At first I provided direct patient care as a Patient Care Technician (CNA) and patient transport, but then after a few years I moved into a supervisory role (Patient Transport Supervisor) where I co-supervised 60 employees and also did scheduling and time keeping.</p>
         
            <p>For the last 3 years I've worked for the Design and Construction Management department where I assist project managers with facilitating construction projects throughout the medical center. I also manage some of the smaller construction projects on my own.</p>

            <p>In my spare time I enjoy spending time with my family, running, watching movies and listening to music. I am also a projectionist at The Grand Illusion Cinema, a volunteer-run movie theater in Seattle.</p>

            <p>In February 2024 I started a certificate course in Front-end Development at the University of Washington in an effort to explore the world of tech as a possible career change.</p>

            <h3>Possible careers...</h3>
            <ul class="careers-list">
                <li><strong>Tech project management</strong> - I enjoy project management and I have an interest in coding, so I am looking into project management within the tech field. I have very little to no experience in tech and thought it would be a good idea to learn some coding to dip my toes.</li>
                <li><strong>UX designer</strong> - With my background in graphic design I figure this would be a good fit for me. I also figure it would be good to learn at least some basic coding so I can communicate better with programmers.</li>
                <li><strong>Full-stack developer</strong> - I've really enjoyed the little bit of coding I've done so far and the idea that coding is essentially problem solving is really attractive to me and I think fits with my skillset. I might find I really enjoy coding and just stick with that route. Learning back-end development and learning the whole process sounds really interesting to me so I think I'd pursue the full-stack path.</li>
